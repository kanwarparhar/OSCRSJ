# OSCRSJ Website — Claude Code Context

## What This Project Is
The official website for **OSCRSJ** (Orthopedic Surgery Case Reports & Series Journal) — Kanwar's independent, open-access orthopedic research journal business targeting medical students, residents, and fellows. Domain: **OSCRSJ.com**. Pre-launch as of April 2026.

---

## Current State
A complete Next.js 14 website — **57 pages total** (35 existing + `/news` landing + `/news/ai-in-orthopedics` + 6 category archives + 2 Editor's Pick guides + 11 inaugural AI-in-Ortho briefs shipped 2026-04-16 + `/for-reviewers/apply` shipped Session 7), all TypeScript-clean, no 404s. The site includes a full auth system (register, login, password reset), author dashboard, ORCID OAuth integration, Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA, and an AI in Orthopedics hub with 2 Editor's Picks + 20-term glossary + the full inaugural 11-brief slate (Imaging ×2, Surgical Planning ×2, Robotics ×2, Outcomes ×1, LLMs ×2, Research Tools ×2) now live across all six categories. **Live at https://oscrsj.com**.

### Deployment & Infrastructure
| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| **Live URL** | https://oscrsj.com |
| **GitHub Repo** | github.com/kanwarparhar/OSCRSJ (public) |
| **Hosting** | Vercel (free tier) — auto-deploys from `main` branch |
| **Domain Registrar** | GoDaddy — DNS configured |
| **DNS Records** | A record: `76.76.21.21` / CNAME: `cname.vercel-dns.com` |
| **SSL** | Active — auto-provisioned by Vercel (HTTPS) |
| **WWW redirect** | apex oscrsj.com → www.oscrsj.com (307). Canonical is `www`. Any webhook URL (Resend, Crossref, ORCID, Stripe) must use the `https://www.oscrsj.com/...` form — posting to the apex 307s and most services do not re-issue the body on redirect. (This was Session 5's Svix-webhook silent-failure root cause.) |
| **Backup URL** | oscrsj.vercel.app |

**How to deploy updates:** Push any commit to the `main` branch on GitHub → Vercel auto-rebuilds and goes live in ~60 seconds.

### What Doesn't Work Yet (known gaps)
- Forms are static (contact, subscribe, search) -- no backend wired
- Search bar in header is non-functional UI
- No real articles published (3 sample placeholders on `/articles`)
- ~~Supabase Storage bucket~~ ✅ Created (private, 50MB max)
- Auth system built but not yet tested on production (Vercel env vars added) — **Session 7 carry-over: auth retest deferred from Sessions 5 & 6**
- File upload RLS on Supabase Storage bucket should be verified with a real upload test
- ~~No email notifications~~ ✅ Full transactional pipeline live as of Session 6 (2026-04-17): submission confirmation + co-author notification + co-author dispute + withdrawal (author/editor/reviewer variants) all confirmed delivering end-to-end via Resend. `Reply-To: kanwarparhar@gmail.com` wired on every send via `DEFAULT_REPLY_TO` in `lib/email/resend.ts` (env var `EMAIL_REPLY_TO` with Gmail fallback).
- ~~No draft withdrawal button on dashboard~~ ✅ Shipped Session 6 (`app/dashboard/WithdrawButton.tsx` + `withdrawManuscript` server action in `lib/submission/actions.ts`). DRAFT/SUBMITTED/UNDER_REVIEW → WITHDRAWN; invited/accepted reviewers auto-cancelled on `review_invitations`.
- Resend webhook must be registered manually in the Resend dashboard (URL `https://www.oscrsj.com/api/webhooks/resend`, events: delivered/bounced/complained/delivery_delayed) and its signing secret copied into `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` on Vercel before delivery status updates will flow.
- Migrations 003 and 004 executed (Session 5). Migration 005 (defensive RLS restore) shipped Session 6 — Kanwar manual. Migrations 006 (`reviewer_applications`) and 007 (`ai_disclosure`) shipped Session 7 — **Kanwar must run both in the Supabase SQL Editor** before the reviewer form + Step 5 AI disclosure will persist.
- ~~No reviewer application form~~ ✅ Shipped Session 7 (`/for-reviewers/apply`). Admin approval UI (`/dashboard/admin/reviewer-applications`) still pending Session 8.
- ~~No AI disclosure mechanism~~ ✅ Shipped Session 7 (Step 5 toggle + conditional textarea + reinforcement line; `getManuscriptAiDisclosure()` getter ready for the future published-article template).
- **AI in Orthopedics hub — inaugural slate complete**: landing has live 20-term glossary + final 150-word primer; 2 of 3 Editor's Picks live (Imaging Primer + LLM Guide). Third Editor's Pick tile (glossary) anchors to `#glossary` on the landing page. `AI_ORTHO_BRIEFS` now carries **11 of 11 inaugural briefs** — Imaging ×2, Surgical Planning ×2, Robotics ×2, Outcomes ×1, LLMs ×2, Research Tools ×2. All six category archives populated and live. First batch of 6 shipped in commit `02cc31e` on 2026-04-16; final batch of 5 (Altahtamouni, Ma, Müller, Yao, Arias Perez) shipped later the same day.
- Hero image at `/news/ai-in-orthopedics` is a placeholder slot. Drop the Canva export at `/public/images/ai-in-ortho-hero.png` (1920×800 web hero + 1200×630 OG export per Page Plan §13) and uncomment the `<Image>` block in `app/news/ai-in-orthopedics/page.tsx` to wire it up.
- Editor's Picks on the hub link to `#` (primer, LLM guide, glossary not yet written). The "For Students hub" link also points to `#` — `/students` doesn't exist yet.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **Fonts:** DM Serif Display (serif headings) + Inter (body) via Google Fonts
- **Backend/Auth:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Row Level Security)
- **CAPTCHA:** Cloudflare Turnstile (managed mode)
- **ORCID:** Public API OAuth 2.0 (profile prefill + verified iD)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (free tier), auto-deploys from `main`

---

## Design System
"Neutral Elegance" palette inspired by newgenre.studio. Dark gradient hero, editorial serif typography, warm tones. All tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` and `app/globals.css`. Design system v2.0 (overhauled 2026-04-12).

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `peach` | `#FFDBBB` | CTA buttons on dark backgrounds, accent highlights |
| `peach-dark` | `#F0C49A` | CTA buttons on light/cream backgrounds |
| `taupe` | `#CCBEB1` | Decorative ONLY (borders, dividers). NEVER for text. |
| `tan` | `#997E67` | Secondary metadata text, hover border on interactive cards |
| `brown` | `#664930` | Accent text on light bg, button text |
| `brown-dark` | `#3d2a18` | Primary text |
| `dark` | `#1c0f05` | Hero bg, nav bg, footer bg |
| `dark-card` | `#261609` | Dark card backgrounds |
| `cream` | `#FFF5EB` | Main page background |
| `cream-alt` | `#F5EAE0` | Alternating section background |
| `white` | `#FFFFFF` | All cards, form inputs, article wells (surface tier) |
| `border` | `rgba(153,126,103,0.12)` | Subtle borders/dividers |

**4-tier visual hierarchy:** dark (#1c0f05) > cream (#FFF5EB) > cream-alt (#F5EAE0) > white (#FFFFFF)

**Fonts:** DM Serif Display (headings) + Inter (body)

**Component classes in `globals.css`:** `.btn-primary` (peach, for dark bg), `.btn-primary-light` (peach-dark + brown border, for light bg), `.btn-outline`, `.btn-ghost`, `.card` (white bg, no hover), `.section-heading`, `.section-label`, `.nav-link`

**Card hover rules:** Interactive cards get `hover:border-tan hover:shadow-sm` (no bg change). Static info cards get no hover.

---

## Business Context (Important for Content Decisions)
- **No publisher.** Fully independent.
- **APC model:** Free in 2026 → $299 (M7-18) → $499 (Y2-3) → $699 (post-PubMed)
- **Waiver policy:** 100% for low-income countries, 50% for lower-middle-income + PGY-1/2 residents/med students, 25% for first-ever publication
- **Backend:** Custom LLM-powered submission system (not OJS) — to be built
- **Goal:** PubMed indexing (~2-year path requiring monthly releases)
- **Target audience:** US-based, med students / residents / fellows
- **Revenue projections:** ~$13K Y1 → ~$72K Y2 → ~$170K Y3

## Immediate Next Steps (for this Claude Code session)

The site is live at oscrsj.com. Session 7 (2026-04-17) shipped `/for-reviewers/apply` reviewer intake form (migration `006_reviewer_applications.sql` + two Resend templates + ApplyForm client component with 10-field intake + consent checkbox) AND AI-assisted-writing disclosure field on Step 5 of the submission wizard (migration `007_ai_disclosure.sql` + `ai_tools_used` boolean + `ai_tools_details` text + reinforcement line + published-article getter `getManuscriptAiDisclosure`). All TypeScript clean. Session 6 (2026-04-17) shipped withdrawal flow + Reply-To header + E2E email pipeline confirmed live. AI in Orthopedics hub: 11 inaugural briefs + 20-term glossary + 2 Editor's Picks live. Session 8 priorities in order:

1. **AI in Orthopedics content population** (Arjun Agent scope — 6 of 10 briefs shipped 2026-04-16)
   - ✅ Glossary v1 (20 terms) — live on landing page accordion
   - ✅ Final 150-word primer (`AI_ORTHO_PRIMER`) — shipped
   - ✅ Editor's Pick: Imaging Primer for Residents — live at `/news/ai-in-orthopedics/guides/imaging-primer-for-residents`
   - ✅ Editor's Pick: LLM Guide for Trainees — live at `/news/ai-in-orthopedics/guides/llm-guide-for-trainees`
   - ✅ 11 inaugural briefs shipped 2026-04-16 across two same-day Cowork sessions: Imaging (commercial-ai-fracture-detection-meta-analysis, deep-learning-cobb-angle-meta-analysis), Surgical Planning (ai-3d-planning-total-hip-arthroplasty-meta-analysis, ar-navigation-pedicle-screw-rct), Robotics (robot-assisted-femoral-shaft-reduction-controlled-trial, robotic-assisted-arthroscopy-hss-review), Outcomes (xgboost-tka-complications-prediction), LLMs (chatgpt-deepseek-aaos-clavicle-guidelines, chatgpt-medicine-applications-challenges-review), Research Tools (chatgpt-orthopedic-literature-review-comparison, ai-research-assistant-orthopedic-resident-review). Path (b) (uploaded PDFs → in-context extraction via `pdftotext -layout`) proved the higher-fidelity route over web fetch.
   - ⏳ Kanwar to supply the Canva hero export per Page Plan §13 (1920×800) and drop at `/public/images/ai-in-ortho-hero.png` — `<Image>` block is already uncommented and waiting
   - ⏳ OG image: drop 1200×630 Canva export at `/public/images/ai-in-ortho-og.png` so social previews render (metadata wired 2026-04-14)

2. **Submission Portal Session 8: Auth polish + admin UI + GDPR** (Sushant Agent scope)
   - Custom auth domain (`auth.oscrsj.com`) so Supabase confirmation links match the sending domain
   - End-to-end auth retest deferred from Sessions 5, 6, and 7 (signup → email → confirm → dashboard)
   - `EMAIL_REPLY_TO=kanwarparhar@gmail.com` env var belongs in Vercel (all 3 envs); currently relying on the code-level fallback in `lib/email/resend.ts`
   - Canonical-domain audit (apex vs `www` — site 307s to `www`; ensure no hardcoded `oscrsj.com` webhook/return URL hits the apex)
   - Admin approval UI for `reviewer_applications` (list view + approve/decline actions at `/dashboard/admin/reviewer-applications`)
   - Stripe payment integration planning (still blocked on LLC, but Brad can spec invoice generation on ACCEPTED → AWAITING_PAYMENT)
   - GDPR export endpoint (author data download on request)
   - Kanwar manual: run migrations `006_reviewer_applications.sql` and `007_ai_disclosure.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor

3. **Submit sitemap to Google Search Console**
   - Go to search.google.com/search-console → add oscrsj.com property
   - Submit https://oscrsj.com/sitemap.xml

4. **Wire up forms**
   - Contact form: connect to Resend or Next.js API route
   - Newsletter signup (`/subscribe`): integrate with Buttondown, Mailchimp, or Resend
   - Add form validation and success/error states

5. **Downloadable templates & checklists**
   - Create downloadable patient consent form template (PDF or DOCX)
   - Create author pre-submission checklist (on Guide for Authors + Submit pages)

6. **Sample articles & reviewer recruitment**
   - Create 1-2 sample/template articles showing what good submissions look like
   - Build a reviewer interest/application form (handled in Session 7, item 2 above)

7. **Publish first articles & launch** (target: mid-2026)
   - Recruit 3-5 initial submissions from your network
   - Complete peer review and publish with Crossref DOIs
   - Begin monthly publication cadence (required for PubMed application)
   - Apply for DOAJ listing after first few issues

### Article Types Accepted (as of 2026-04-12)
All defined with full specs on `/guide-for-authors`:
- **Case Report** (1-3 patients, 2000 words, CARE checklist required)
- **Case Series** (4+ patients, 3000 words, JBI checklist required)
- **Surgical Technique** (1500 words, min 4 figures, video encouraged)
- **Images in Orthopedics** (500 words, 1-4 images, expedited 7-10 day review)
- **Letter to the Editor** (600 words, commentary on published work)
- **Review Article** (3500 words, invited only in Year 1)

## What Kanwar Wants Claude Code to Focus On
- He is **non-technical** but comfortable using Claude Code with Opus
- Prefer clear, self-contained components over abstracted systems
- Design uses the "Neutral Elegance" palette (dark hero, warm browns/peach, DM Serif Display headings) inspired by newgenre.studio
- Every page should be complete with real content (no lorem ipsum left behind)
- The site should look credible and polished on day one — it's a professional journal
